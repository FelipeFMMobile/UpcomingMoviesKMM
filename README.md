# UpcomingMovies Kotlin Multiplatform POC

This is a proof-of-concept project that demonstrates the use of Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) in a mobile app project. 
The focus of this project is to show how KMP can be used to share code between Android and iOS platforms in a simple app that displays upcoming movies.

## Technologies Used

The technologies used in this project include:

- **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP):** A technology that enables developers to share code between different platforms, such as Android and iOS.
- **Kotlin Coroutines:** A library for managing asynchronous operations in Kotlin.
- **SwiftUI:** A declarative user interface framework for building apps in iOS.
- **Xcode:** An integrated development environment (IDE) for building iOS apps.
- **Android Studio:** An IDE for building Android apps.

## What is Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)?

Kotlin Multiplatform is a technology that allows developers to share code between different platforms, such as Android and iOS. With KMP, developers can write business logic, networking code, and other non-platform-specific code in Kotlin and use it across multiple platforms. This helps to reduce duplication of code and increase productivity.
